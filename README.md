ðŸ•¹ Guess the Wordâ€¦ or Lose a Language!
Welcome to the ultimate coding doomsday challenge. You have 8 tries to guess the secret word. Each wrong guess doesnâ€™t just cost you a life, it wipes one programming language off the face of the Earth!

Save JavaScript, rescue Python, protect Rustâ€¦ but beware: if you fail, only Assembly will remain. And no one wants to live in that timeline.

So sharpen your mind, channel your inner code savior, and guess wisely, the future of programming depends on you! ðŸ’»âš¡
